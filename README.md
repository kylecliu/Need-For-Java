This is a game in which you control a vehicle on a highway with the aim to reach the other side while avoiding obstacles along the way. There are 3 types of vehicle as well as 3 difficulty levels to choose from. My first program in Java for an assignment. The "Game.java" file is where the main function is located for starting the game.
